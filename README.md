# Social network (web-application)

It's my first attempt in Angular framework. As a base markup I've taken JSP-based frontend from my previous project (see on github below). 

Here's no backend at all, so that, an each time you reloading a project, you'll get the same data from preset json files.

## Under to hood

### Angular v1.5.8
- Controllers
- Directives
- Filters
- Routing
- Services

### Bootstrap v3.3.7

## Third-party libraries
- [Ui-bootstrab](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
- [Letter avatar by Artur Heinze](https://agentejo.com/blog/tired-of-gravatar-try-letter-avatar) in addition to profile photos
- [Show errors by Paul Yoger](https://github.com/paulyoder/angular-bootstrap-show-errors) for validation issues

## Plans for the future

- Implement backend based on Spring & Hibernate
- Resolve issues (authorisation, authentication, role management, security & etc.)
